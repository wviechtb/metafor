\details{
   The plot shows the observed effect sizes or outcomes with corresponding confidence intervals.

   For an equal- and a random-effects model (i.e., for models without moderators), a four-sided polygon, sometimes called a summary \sQuote{diamond}, is added to the bottom of the forest plot, showing the summary estimate based on the model (with the center of the polygon corresponding to the estimate and the left/right edges indicating the confidence interval limits). The \code{col} and \code{border} arguments can be used to adjust the (border) color of the polygon. Drawing of the polgyon can be suppressed by setting \code{addfit=FALSE}.

   For random-effects models and if \code{addpred=TRUE}, a dotted line is added to the summary polygon which indicates the bounds of the prediction interval (the interval estimates where \code{level} \% of the true outcomes are expected to fall) (Riley et al., 2011). For random-effects models of class \code{"rma.mv"} (see \code{\link{rma.mv}}) with multiple \mjseqn{\tau^2} values, the \code{addpred} argument can be used to specify for which level of the inner factor the prediction interval should be provided (since the intervals differ depending on the \mjseqn{\tau^2} value). If the model should also contain multiple \mjseqn{\gamma^2} values, the \code{addpred} argument should then be of length 2 to specify the levels of both inner factors. See also \code{\link[=predict.rma]{predict}}, which is used to compute these interval bounds.

   For meta-regression models (i.e., models involving moderators), the fitted value for each study is added as a polygon to the plot. By default, the width of the polygons corresponds to the confidence interval limits for the fitted values. By setting \code{addpred=TRUE}, the width reflects the prediction interval limits. Again, the \code{col} and \code{border} arguments can be used to adjust the (border) color of the polygons. These polygons can be suppressed by setting \code{addfit=FALSE}.

   With the \code{transf} argument, the observed outcomes, summary estimate, fitted values, confidence interval bounds, and prediction interval bounds can be transformed with some suitable function. For example, when plotting log odds ratios, one could use \code{transf=exp} to obtain a forest plot showing the odds ratios. Alternatively, one can use the \code{atransf} argument to transform the x-axis labels and annotations (e.g., \code{atransf=exp}). See also \link{transf} for some other useful transformation functions in the context of a meta-analysis. The examples below illustrate the use of these arguments.

   By default, the studies are ordered from top to bottom (i.e., the first study in the dataset will be placed in row \mjseqn{k}, the second study in row \mjseqn{k-1}, and so on, until the last study, which is placed in the first row). The studies can be reordered with the \code{order} argument:

   \itemize{
   \item \code{order="obs"}: the studies are ordered by the observed outcomes,
   \item \code{order="fit"}: the studies are ordered by the fitted values,
   \item \code{order="prec"}: the studies are ordered by their sampling variances,
   \item \code{order="resid"}: the studies are ordered by the size of their residuals,
   \item \code{order="rstandard"}: the studies are ordered by the size of their standardized residuals,
   \item \code{order="abs.resid"}: the studies are ordered by the size of their absolute residuals,
   \item \code{order="abs.rstandard"}: the studies are ordered by the size of their absolute standardized residuals.
   }

   Alternatively, it is also possible to set \code{order} equal to a variable based on which the studies will be ordered (see \sQuote{Examples}).

   Additional columns with information about the studies can be added to the plot via the \code{ilab} argument. This can either be a single variable or an entire matrix / data frame (with as many rows as there are studies in the forest plot). The \code{ilab.xpos} argument can then also be specified to indicate the horizontal position of the variables specified via \code{ilab}.

   \if{html}{The figure below illustrates how the elements in a forest plot can be arranged and the meaning of the some of the arguments such as \code{xlim}, \code{alim} or \code{at}, \code{ilab}, and \code{ilab.xpos}.}

   \if{html}{\figure{forest-arrangement.png}{options: width=800}}

   \if{html}{The figure corresponds to the following code: \preformatted{dat <- escalc(measure="RR", ai=tpos, bi=tneg, ci=cpos, di=cneg, data=dat.bcg)

text(c(-8.75,-5.25),     res$k+3, c("Vaccinated", "Control"),    cex=0.75, font=2)}}

   Additional summary estimates can be added to the plot with the \code{\link{addpoly}} function. See the documentation for that function for examples.

   When \code{showweights=TRUE}, the annotations will include information about the weights given to the observed outcomes during the model fitting. For simple models (such as those fitted with the \code{\link{rma.uni}} function), these weights correspond to the \sQuote{inverse-variance weights} (but are given in percent). For models fitted with the \code{\link{rma.mv}} function, the weights are based on the diagonal of the weight matrix. Note that the weighting structure is typically more complex in such models (i.e., the weight matrix is usually not just a diagonal matrix) and the weights shown therefore do not reflect this complexity. See \code{\link[=weights.rma]{weights}} for more details (for the special case that \code{x} is an intercept-only \code{"rma.mv"} model, one can also set \code{showweights="rowsum"} to show the \sQuote{row-sum weights}).

   By default (i.e., when \code{psize} is not specified), the point sizes are a function of the square root of the model weights. This way, their areas are proportional to the weights. However, the point sizes are rescaled so that the smallest point size is \code{plim[1]} and the largest point size is \code{plim[2]}. As a result, their relative sizes (i.e., areas) no longer exactly correspond to their relative weights. If exactly relative point sizes are desired, one can set \code{plim[2]} to \code{NA}, in which case the points are rescaled so that the smallest point size corresponds to \code{plim[1]} and all other points are scaled accordingly. As a result, the largest point may be very large. Alternatively, one can set \code{plim[1]} to \code{NA}, in which case the points are rescaled so that the largest point size corresponds to \code{plim[2]} and all other points are scaled accordingly. As a result, the smallest point may be very small and essentially indistinguishable from the confidence interval line. To avoid the latter, one can also set \code{plim[3]}, which enforces a minimal point size.

   With the \code{shade} argument, one can shade rows of the plot. The argument can be set to one of the following character strings: \code{"zebra"} (same as \code{shade=TRUE}) or \code{"zebra2"} to use zebra-style shading (starting either at the first or second study) or to \code{"all"} in which case all rows are shaded. Alternatively, the argument can be set to a logical or numeric vector to indicates which rows should be shaded. The \code{colshade} argument can be used to set the color of shaded rows.
}
\section{Note}{
   The function sets some sensible values for the optional arguments, but it may be necessary to adjust these in certain circumstances.

   The function actually returns some information about the chosen values invisibly. Printing this information is useful as a starting point to make adjustments to the plot (see \sQuote{Examples}).

   Arguments \code{slab} and \code{ilab} and when specifying vectors for arguments \code{pch}, \code{psize}, \code{order}, and/or \code{colout} (and when \code{shade} is a logical vector), the variables specified are assumed to be of the same length as the data originally passed to the model fitting function (and if the \code{data} argument was used in the original model fit, then the variables will be searched for within this data frame first). Any subsetting and removal of studies with missing values is automatically applied to the variables specified via these arguments.

   If the number of studies is quite large, the labels, annotations, and symbols may become quite small and impossible to read. Stretching the plot window vertically may then provide a more readable figure (one should call the function again after adjusting the window size, so that the label/symbol sizes can be properly adjusted). Also, the \code{cex}, \code{cex.lab}, and \code{cex.axis} arguments are then useful to adjust the symbol and text sizes.

   If the outcome measure used for creating the plot is bounded (e.g., correlations are bounded between -1 and +1, proportions are bounded between 0 and 1), one can use the \code{olim} argument to enforce those limits (the observed outcomes and confidence/prediction intervals cannot exceed those bounds then).

   The models without moderators, the \code{col} argument can also be a vector of two elements, the first for specifying the color of the summary polygon, the second for specifying the color of the line for the prediction interval.

   The \code{lty} argument can also be a vector of up to three elements, the first for specifying the line type of the individual CIs (\code{"solid"} by default), the second for the line type of the prediction interval (\code{"dotted"} by default), the third for the line type of the horizontal lines that are automatically added to the plot (\code{"solid"} by default; set to \code{"blank"} to remove them).
}
\section{Additional Optional Arguments}{
   There are some additional optional arguments that can be passed to the function via \code{...} (hence, they cannot be abbreviated):
   \describe{
   \item{top}{single numeric value to specify the amount of space (in terms of number of rows) to leave empty at the top of the plot (e.g., for adding headers). The default is 3.}
   \item{annosym}{vector of length 3 to select the left bracket, separation, and right bracket symbols for the annotations. The default is \code{c(" [", ", ", "]")}. Can also include a 4th element to adjust the look of the minus symbol, for example to use a proper minus sign (\ifelse{latex}{\mjseqn{-}}{\enc{−}{-}}) instead of a hyphen-minus (-). Can also include a 5th element that should be a space-like symbol (e.g., an \sQuote{en space}) that is used in place of numbers (only relevant when trying to line up numbers exactly). For example, \code{annosym=c(" [", ", ", "]", "\u2212", "\u2002")} would use a proper minus sign and an \sQuote{en space} for the annotations.}
   \item{tabfig}{single numeric value (either a 1, 2, or 3) to set \code{annosym} automatically to a vector that will exactly align the numbers in the annotations when using a font that provides \sQuote{tabular figures}. Value 1 corresponds to using \code{"\u2212"} (a minus) and \code{"\u2002"} (an \sQuote{en space}) in \code{annoyym} as shown above. Value 2 corresponds to \code{"\u2013"} (an \sQuote{en dash}) and \code{"\u2002"} (an \sQuote{en space}). Value 3 corresponds to \code{"\u2212"} (a minus) and \code{"\u2007"} (a \sQuote{figure space}). The appropriate value for this argument depends on the font used. For example, for fonts Calibri and Carlito, 1 or 2 should work; for fonts Source Sans 3 and Palatino Linotype, 1, 2, and 3 should all work; for Computer/Latin Modern and Segoe UI, 2 should work; for Lato, Roboto, and Open Sans (and maybe Arial), 3 should work. Other fonts may work as well, but this is untested.}
   \item{textpos}{numeric vector of length 2 to specify the placement of the study labels and the annotations. The default is to use the horizontal limits of the plot region, i.e., the study labels to the right of \code{xlim[1]} and the annotations to the left of \code{xlim[2]}.}
   \item{rowadj}{numeric vector of length 3 to vertically adjust the position of the study labels, the annotations, and the extra information (if specified via \code{ilab}). This is useful for fine-tuning the position of text added with different positional alignments (i.e., argument \code{pos} in the \code{\link{text}} function).}
